# WBAN-research-project
This research project aims at finding a novel forwarding function to enhance overall network throughput. There are two python files in the repository. The one titled "traditional approach" simulates a network in python3 wherein the forwarding function is traditional and no machine learning techniques have been used.
The second one titled "IDEB" is based on K-means clustering approach to solve the issue. A jupyter notebook with relevant code has also been attached.
